#Genomics workshop

- The modules in this workshop cover microbial genomics, from assembly to annotation and variant calling:

    - Starting with Galaxy
    - Training dataset
    - Quality control
    - Genome assembly with two tools - Velvet and Spades
    - Genome annotation
    - Variant finding

- The analyses are conducted on the Galaxy platform, and links to training data are provided.

- These modules can be delivered to a group workshop or used online independently.

- If you have not yet used the Galaxy platform, we recommend following the modules in order.

- If you are using these tutorials outside of a workshop and need access to Galaxy, you can follow the instructions on the homepage [here](../../index.md) to obtain your own mGVL instance with Galaxy and command line tools.

- *Note:* There are also additional tutorials listed under the "Genomics" tab (such as PacBio assembly), but these may require different data sets and tools.
